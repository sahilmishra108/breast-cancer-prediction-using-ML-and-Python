# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning and Python

## Overview
This project aims to predict breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on input features.

## Features
- Uses a breast cancer dataset
- Implements multiple machine learning models
- Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation
- Visualizes results using plots and graphs

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset used is likely the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** from scikit-learn.
- The data consists of features extracted from tumor samples to classify them as benign or malignant.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Breast Cancer Prediction using ML and python.ipynb"
   ```
2. Run all cells to execute data processing, model training, and evaluation.
3. View results and visualizations generated in the notebook.

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: **Varies based on the model chosen**
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models such as Neural Networks
- Enhance feature engineering techniques
- Deploy the model using Flask/Django for web-based predictions
